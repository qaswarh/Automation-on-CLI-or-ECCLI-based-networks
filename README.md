# Automation-on-CLI-or-ECCLI-based-networks
Choosing cli_command and/or eric_eccli_command modules for automation and configuration management

When started with configuration and automation on Ericsson nodes, found [eric_eccli_command](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/eric_eccli_command_module.html) module introduced in Ansible 2.9 

All flavors of both commands in the module worked with ansible_connection and ansible_network_os introduced in the inventory, as per [ERIC_ECCLI Platform Options](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/network/user_guide/platform_eric_eccli.html). The predefined checks in result[0] and result[1], used in wait_for parameter, give clue to the Ansible user that at least commands are getting executed on the server(s)

As I understood result[0] can be used for all commands, including the 'show version' where grep can be made on the string 'IPOS' similary result[1] is set for 'management' to check the output for. Is one of the two strings always present in the output of any ECCLI? Where are the rest of result[i] definitions otherwise? i.e. what are the rest of result[i] supposed to contain? No relevant description found 

Irrespective of presumbale commmand execution on the server(s), the Ansible user stays blind with the output of the command being run on the server. The module does not support the register parameter, as an example, to store the output for Ansible user to view or further play with the registered info.

[cli_command](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/cli_command_module.html), introduced in Ansible 2.7, amazingly had no issue in running the both commands, described in [eric_eccli_command](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/eric_eccli_command_module.html) documentation, on Ericsson ECCLI/IPOS network. And the module also supports registering the output.

Get your inventory ready with hosts and vars like ansible_connection, ansible_user, ansible_ssh_pass (though plain text not recommmended), ansible_network_os to try both modules
